# Cross-hatching

This webpage renders an image by cross-hatching SVG lines. Moving the mouse produces a subtle 3d effect. I spent about four hours writing code, but I spent a lot more just thinking about the problem. All you have to do to run it is open `index.html` in Safari (I'm in Safari 10.0). Unfortunately it does not work on Chrome at the moment, but it looks like a minor bug.
